# Tasks — Product Intake Dashboard

Ordered, independently-verifiable tasks derived from [plan.md](plan.md). Phase A ships value on its own; Phase B is gated behind an explicit business decision. Nothing here is built yet.

## Phase A — embedded dashboard + automated delegation

### A1 — Intake schema & store
- Create `data/product-intake.schema.json` and an empty `data/product-intake.json` (`[]`).
- Enforce: required fields, status/priority/imageRights enums, ISO dates, and `affiliateKeyRef` must not contain `http`.
- **Verify:** `node scripts/validate_intake.mjs` passes on a valid sample and fails on a URL-in-key sample.

### A2 — Validation test
- Add `scripts/validate_intake.mjs` (exported helpers, existing style) and `tests/intake.test.mjs`.
- **Verify:** `node --test tests/intake.test.mjs` green; wire into `npm test`.

### A3 — IntakeSource port + FileIntakeSource
- Define the `IntakeSource` interface and implement `FileIntakeSource` (list/get/setStatus/setDelegation/promote). `promote()` runs `vault:gate` before writing canonical.
- **Verify:** a unit test drives an item `new → dispatched → …→ promoted` against a temp file; promote refuses when the gate fails.

### A4 — Orchestrator routine (automated dispatch)
- Add the "process the intake queue" routine to `sahla-product-manager`; add `data/product-intake.json` to its lane in `.vault/agent-lanes.json`.
- Add `scripts/intake-process.mjs` (manual: `npm run intake:process -- IN-xxxx`) that invokes the orchestrator via the Claude Agent SDK.
- **Verify:** running it on a `new` item sets `dispatched` + delegation flags and appends a ledger line.

### A5 — Watcher (the automation)
- Add `scripts/intake-watch.mjs` (`fs.watch`, debounced) → emits `product.added` → calls A4. Expose `npm run intake:watch`.
- **Verify:** with the watcher running, adding an item to the JSON auto-triggers dispatch with no manual command.

### A6 — Agent pickup (research + creative)
- Update `sahla-research` and `sahla-creative` briefs to read their delegation flags and flip them to `done` after staging their outputs.
- **Verify:** end-to-end on one test product: research writes `research/*.csv`, creative writes `assets/generated/`, both flags `done`, item reaches `ready`.

### A7 — Admin UI (dev-only)
- Add `/admin` route (React+Vite+Tailwind) behind `ADMIN_ENABLED`; table + add/edit form; dev-only write endpoint with atomic write.
- **Verify:** `npm run dev` → add a product via the form → item appears + validates; the production build excludes `/admin`.

### A8 — Affiliate injection + promotion polish
- Build-time resolver maps `affiliateKeyRef` → real URL from the vault; missing key → public URL + `DIRECT_LINK — AFFILIATE ID REQUIRED`.
- **Verify:** a product with a vault key renders the real link in `npm run build`; without a key, the compliant fallback renders.

**Phase A done when:** the US1–US5 acceptance criteria in [spec.md](spec.md) all pass, and `npm run vault:gate` + `npm test` are green.

## Phase B — SaaS extraction (future; needs go-ahead)

### B1 — Supabase schema
- `product_intake` table with `org_id`, RLS policies, status/delegation columns. Migration via Supabase MCP.

### B2 — SupabaseIntakeSource
- Second `IntakeSource` adapter over Postgres. **No changes to orchestration logic** (proves the seam).

### B3 — Event trigger
- DB webhook / Edge Function on `insert(status='new')` → Cloudflare Queues → orchestrator worker. Same `product.added` contract.

### B4 — Hosted dashboard + auth
- Next.js dashboard on Cloudflare Pages/Vercel + Supabase Auth; reuse the Phase-A React components.

### B5 — Tenancy, secrets, billing
- Encrypted affiliate-secret storage per org; Stripe plans; per-org agent-run metering.

**Phase B done when:** a second tenant adds a product in the hosted dashboard and the same orchestrator delegates it — with only the adapter swapped, orchestration code untouched (US6).

## Suggested build order

A1 → A2 → A3 → A4 → A5 → A6 → A7 → A8, then re-evaluate for Phase B. A1–A6 already make automated delegation real from hand-edited JSON before the UI exists.
